Question 5

Firstly, we chose to implement Subject and Observer instead of using java.util. Then, we decided to make
ClockTimer extend from Subject because it is the component that updates the data.

Thus, we chose to use the push model as we thought it was more representative it this code architecture.
(We get the information by watching the clock itself)
Moreover, we judged that it was easier to implement in this package.
